### About me :sunglasses:

Hi, I'm nwunder! I'm an aerospace engineering student and self-taught Python developer.
I mostly just program for fun, and love to show off my projects on Github!
You'll mostly find me on Discord, spending time with one of my communities or working on one of my many open-source projects.

Recently, I started up [SinkingYachts](https://sinking.yachts), a place for me to consolidate my cybersecurity-related projects.
Working against phishing and malware scams on Discord, doing my part to make the internet a little bit safer.

My website: https://nwunder.com

### My favorite projects:
- [starlette-discord](https://github.com/nwunderly/starlette-discord), a Python module for integrating Discord's OAuth2 flow with ASGI web apps.
- [aionasa](https://github.com/nwunderly/aionasa), an async Python wrapper for the NASA Open APIs.
- [SinkingYachts](https://github.com/SinkingYachts), a personal cybersecurity project!
- [Ouranos](https://github.com/nwunderly/ouranos), my powerful and somewhat opinionated Discord moderation bot.
- [Fun Police](https://github.com/nwunderly/fun-police), a Discord bot that detects Rick Rolls.
- [InspiroBot-bot](https://github.com/nwunderly/inspirobot-bot), a very well-named project that brings [InspiroBot](https://inspirobot.me) to Discord.

### Help me out
If you like what I do, you're welcome to buy me a coffee! All donations will go towards hosting costs for my projects and/or coffee to feed my caffeine addiction. <3 <br>
