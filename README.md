### About me :sunglasses:

Hi, I'm nwunder! I'm an aerospace engineering student and self-taught Python developer.
I mostly just program for fun, and love to show off my projects on Github!

My website: https://nwunder.com

### My favorite projects:
- [aionasa](https://github.com/nwunderly/aionasa), an async Python wrapper for the NASA Open APIs.
- [starlette-discord](https://github.com/nwunderly/starlette-discord), a Python module for integrating Discord's OAuth2 flow with ASGI web apps.
- [SinkingYachts](https://github.com/SinkingYachts), my nonprofit cybersecurity project! Working against phishing and malware scams on Discord to make the internet a little bit safer.
- [Ouranos](https://github.com/nwunderly/ouranos), my powerful and somewhat opinionated Discord moderation bot.
- [Fun Police](https://github.com/nwunderly/Rickroll-warning-system), a Discord bot that detects Rick Rolls.
- [InspiroBot-bot](https://github.com/nwunderly/inspirobot-bot), a very well-named project that brings [InspiroBot](https://inspirobot.me) to Discord.

#### Help me out
If you like what I do, you're welcome to buy me a coffee! All donations will go towards hosting for my projects and/or coffee to feed my caffeine addiction. <3 <br>
